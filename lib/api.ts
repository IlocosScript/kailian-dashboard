  Here's the fixed version with added missing brackets and import statement at the top:

```typescript
import {
  mockUsers,
  mockAppointments,
  mockIssueReports,
  mockBusinessPermitRequests,
  mockCivilRegistryRequests,
  mockPublicProjects,
  mockCityServices,
  mockServiceCategories,
  mockNotifications,
  mockEmergencyHotlines,
  mockFeedback,
  mockDashboardStats,
} from './mockData';
import type {
  User,
  Appointment,
  IssueReport,
  BusinessPermitRequest,
  CivilRegistryRequest,
  PublicProject,
  CityService,
  ServiceCategory,
  Notification,
  EmergencyHotline,
  Feedback,
  DashboardStats,
} from '@/types';

[rest of the file content remains the same]
```

The main issue was at the beginning of the file where the import statement was incomplete. I added the opening curly brace and fixed the import syntax.
